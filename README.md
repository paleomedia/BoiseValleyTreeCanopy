# BoiseValleyTreeCanopy
Treasure Valley Idaho tree canopy data combined with 2013 American Community Survey demographic data

##Background
A recent article in (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/journal-information) [PLOS One], a peer-reviewed, open access journal, discussed urban tree canopies in Baltimore, LA, New York, Philadelphia, Raleigh, Sacramento and Washington, D.C. as tree cover relates to socioecomonic factors and environmental justice.

The article, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4382324/) [*Trees Grow on Money: Urban Tree Canopy Cover and Environmental Justice*], asserts: 

> Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) cover is widely regarded as an environmental good or amenity. UTC cover as an environmental amenity stems from the direct flow of perceived benefits, or ecosystem services, to people and neighborhoods where UTC cover is found.

We worked with Michail Fragkias, one of the article's co-authors and an economist at Boise State University, to reproduce the data for the Boise Valley, also know as the Treasure Valley, a two-county area in SW Idaho.

This repository contains the data we used in the analysis.
